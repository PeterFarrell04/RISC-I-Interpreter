# RISC-I Interpreter

A RISC-I Interpreter Built in Java

## Project Motivation

I recently learned about the architecture and language of RISC-I.
I was surprised there were no prominent resources online for writing and compiling correct RISC-I code.
This project seeks to provide a way to run and test RISC-I code (to a degree).
There may be innaccuracies, but this project strives to be accurate to RISC-I syntax and architecture.
